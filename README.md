# cryptopals
Challenges from https://cryptopals.com/.

WARNING: This is an academic proof-of-concept prototype, and in particular has not received careful code review. This implementation is NOT ready for production use.

## Methodoly
_DIY, build everything from scratch_
- minimum dependencies (crates).
- implement each and every thing.
- should be modular and can be used outside this project.

## Project Structure
This project is organised as a Cargo Workspace with two types of crates, challenges and utiltiy crates.

- [`challenges`](./challenges) - Crates for individual Problem Set and each crate contain only tests which represent the challanges and no other logic.
- [`packages`](./packages) - Utility crates like, aes, hex, base64, etc.

## `packages`
Utiltiy crates which are complelety functional on thier own to be used outside the scope of this project.
- ### [`aes`](./packages/aes)
  Implementations for AES128, AES192, AES256.
  - Complete AES Cipher & Inver Cipher implementation. (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.197.pdf)
  - Supports multiple padding schemes and block modes.
  - Supports PKCS7 Padding Scheme.
  - Supports CBC & ECB Block modes.

- ### [`enscoring`](./packages/enscoring)
  English text scoring & metric utilites.
  - Based on English character frequency table. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequency)
  - Use _Bhattacharyya coefficient_ for calculating score for given english text. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhattacharyya_distance)

- ### [`naivebase64`](./packages/naivebase64)
  Naive Base64 encoding & decoding implementation.

- ### [`hex`](./packages/hex)
  Hex encoding and decoding from hex string implementation.

- ### [`xor`](./packages/xor)
  Utiltiy methods for XOR based key encryptions.
  - Break Single XOR Key
  - Break Repeating XOR Key
